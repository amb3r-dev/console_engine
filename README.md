# Console Engine (Demiforge)

[Link to original crate repo](https://github.com/VincentFoulon80/console_engine)

This fork will heavily diverge from the original crate, implementing features I need, and refactoring/replacing certain critical structs and methods.

Documentation may be incomplete/inconsistent.

The following features have been added:
* Bold, italic, and underline.
* Multidirectional mouse scrolling.
